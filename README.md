# **Analysis of Ecological Dynamics on Topographic Slopes**

This repository contains the data, analyses, and results of a project focused on studying differences in the density and distribution of individuals across internal and external slopes. The primary goal was to evaluate how topographic characteristics influence the structuring of ecological communities, considering potential biases introduced by sampling design and environmental conditions.

## **Project Summary**

The comparative analysis focused on two slope types:  
- **Internal slopes**: Characterized by vegetation that stabilizes the soil, reduces erosion, and creates stable microhabitats.  
- **External slopes**: Steeper and more dynamic areas with less vegetation cover and more exposed environmental conditions.  

### **Key Findings**  
1. Higher density of individuals on external slopes, likely associated with reduced competition and greater environmental heterogeneity.  
2. Limited influence of elevation on individual density within the studied range.  
3. The importance of vegetation as a mediator of microclimatic stability and community structuring.  

## **Limitations and Potential Biases**

Some limitations that may have introduced biases in the results include:  
- Small sample size and null abundance values in some cases.  
- Sampling design that may not fully capture the variability of the studied zones.  

To address these challenges in future studies, we recommend increasing the sample size, improving sampling point distribution, and considering additional factors such as temperature, humidity, and soil composition.
